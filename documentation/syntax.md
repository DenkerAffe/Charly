# Syntax

Charly has the following syntax elements:

**Integer literals**  
Using the digits `0-9`.
To push multiple Integer literals in a row separate them with whitespaces.

**String literals**  
Wrapped in double quotes `"`.
A closing quote is not necessary if it would be the last character of the
program.
Strings are handled as a special case of lists where each list element is a
one-character string.
So all commands that have lists specified as arguments can also consume strings.

**Single character string literals**  
Started with an apostrophe `'`.
Only the following character gets pushed as a string literal.

**Doublestring literals**  
Wrapped in 3 forwardticks `Â´`.
If the last quote is not given, the rest of the code is pushed as the 2nd
string.
This is a shortcut to push 2 strings to the stack which can happen quite
frequently.

**Command literals**  
Wrapped in curly braces `{...}`. A Command literal can be executed using the `#`
command or be consumed by various other functional commands.

**Single character command literals**  
Started with an exclamation mark `!`.
Only the following character gets pushed as a command literal.

**Lists**  
Wrapped in square brackets `[...]`.
The content of the list is evaluated as code with its own stack.
The resulting stack is then the base for the list.
When converted to a string, all elements of the list are first converted to a
string and then joined together without a separator.

**Variables**  
Charly has a set of predefined variables which can pushed to the stack by just
writing them.
A list of all variables is available [here](variables.md).
New variables can be assigned by using the `=` command followed by the variable
name.
The top item of the stack is then assigned to that name.
This item is **not** removed from the stack.
Variable names can only be one character long and overwrite their previous
meaning.

**Commands**  
Everything that is not a literal or a variable is a command and manipulates the
stack in a certain way.
A list of all commands is available [here](commands.md).
All commands pop the needed arguments from the stack and push a result.
