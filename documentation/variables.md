# Variables

Charly has a set of preinitialized variables.
It is also possible to define custom variables with the = command.
Variable names can only be one character long and defining custom
variables overrides the default meaning of the chosen character.  
Variables can not only be String or Integers, but also Commands. This
allows to save a set of commands in a variable to use it multiple times.
