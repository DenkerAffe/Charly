## Contribute

If you want to implement planned commands, having an idea about a new command
or want to add some new fancy feaueres, go ahead and create a pull-request.
However, make sure that all existing tests pass (shouldn't be an issue when only
adding new commands) and that the new feature is covered by tests.
